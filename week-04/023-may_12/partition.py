#         Coding Interview Question
#
#                PARTITION
#  Write code to partition a linked list
#  around a value x, such that all nodes
#  less than x come before all nodes
#  greater than or equal to x. If x is
#  contained within the list, the values
#  of x only need to be after the
#  elements less than x (see below).
#  The partition element x can appear
#  anywhere in the "right partition"; 
#  it does not need to appear between
#  the left and right partitions.
